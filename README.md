# Work Day Scheduler

A web application for scheduling events within your morning.

# Description

This simple application was made using JavaScript and jQuery. It takes in input from the user in three different time blocks, and then saves that data in local storage for later use. It also will visually display for the user whether the time block is in the past, present, or future by changing the background color.

To use this application, type your activities / appointments within their respective time blocks, then press save using the button on the right.
